#Jewelry Store Launch

##**Project Owner:** Rhonda Malecki
##**Total Project Deliverable Summary:**
I am planning to launch an online jewelry store by the end of the year, using this course as the launching pad to get me there. The deliverables for this project will be three-fold: a marketing plan, a logo, and a draft website. 
##**Technology List:**

**1.	Digital Camera** – for photographing jewelry 

**2.	Photography Backdrop Kit** – for photographing jewelry 

**3.	Adobe Illustrator** – for creating the logo 

**4.	Adobe Photoshop** – for editing photos and (if time permits) using the logo in things like banners and business cards 

**5.	HTML** – Web site structure 

**6.	CSS** – Web site style 

**7.	JavaScript** – for any interactive elements on the Web site 

**8.	FileZilla** – FTP client 

**9.	Chrome** – I will be working primarily in Chrome, but will also be trying to achieve browser compatibility in Firefox, IE, etc. 

**10.	MCAD studio server** – This is the server that will be used for the developing the draft Web site (with plans to move the site to a contracted server when it’s time to actually launch the final product) 

**11.	Notepad++ text editor** – As a PC user, this is my text editor of choice. 

**12.	GitHub** – This is the tool I will be using to share my files with others in this class. 

**13.	Etsy** – This is what I will be using for actual transactions. It probably won’t come into play until after this course, but it’s possible that I will get to the point of setting this up too, so I can link my site back to my Etsy listings/shopping cart options. 

**14.	Facebook** –I plan to use this to advertise my store to family, friends, and beyond. I’m not sure if this step will be something that I get to during class, but I will be discussing it in my marketing plan.
